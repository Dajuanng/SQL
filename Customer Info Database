Below you will find a sql where I was given a database and practiced finiding information and quantifiying statistics on customer data within the
databse. 
The questions I aimed to answer as well as the queries i used to find are listed below. 

How many orders were placed in January? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales;

How many of those orders were for an iPhone? 
SELECT COUNT(orderid)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product='iPhone';

Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February. 
SELECT acctnum
FROM customers
INNER JOIN FebSales 
ON customers.order_id=Febsales.orderid;

Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price? 
SELECT distinct product, price FROM JanSales 
ORDER BY price ASC 
LIMIT 1

What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT sum(quantity)*price as revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY product
